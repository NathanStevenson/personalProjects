# personalProjects
Python, Java, C++

class_time_uva pulls data from an excel sheet saved on my PC and outputs a list of all classes that start and end at the specified time

class_difficulty_uva pulls data from the website "theCourseForum" via regex. Outputs class difficulty, avg gpa, and prof name -- working on adding a feature that filters out professors who taught the class > 3 years ago

This folder is strictly for personal projects. I hope to add more to these in the coming years, but right now a majority of my large projects are for school, and cannot be shared on a public GitHub.

After I finish the C++ course I am in right now I hope to design a video game in it. I am going to keep doing small projects in Python, and practice some of my Java skills.

I also intend on learning Rust and Swift in the upcoming breaks so I can further broaden my coding skills.
